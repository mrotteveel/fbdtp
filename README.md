fbdtp
=====

fbdtp is an [Eclipse Data Tools Project](http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/datatools) implementation for the [Firebird database](http://www.firebirdsql.org/).

Binaries are available in [the releases area](https://github.com/mrotteveel/fbdtp/releases) and on http://www.lawinegevaar.nl/firebird (old releases only).

The code is licensed under the [Eclipse Public License v1.0](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).

**NOTE:** This project has been dormant for a few years and is not (yet) compatible with recent versions of Eclipse / Eclipse Data Tools Project.

Ultimately I intend to get this project added to the normal Eclipse Data Tools Platform distribution. As far as I know there are some legal hurdles to contribute to Eclipse, so I currently do not accept code contributions until I have identified exactly what those legal hurdles are.
